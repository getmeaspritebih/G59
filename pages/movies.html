            <h2 style="color: white;">O PANA!  </h2>
            <p style="color: white;"> 
                “O PANA!” perfectly translates $UICIDEBOY$‘ excessive drug use. The beat, created by $crim, was inspired by fellow rapper Lil Ugly Mane—whom is also famous for songs with dark beats and heavy lyrics which [usually] depict nefarious characteristics.

The title, “O Pana!” relates to a powerful narcotic containing Oxymorphone but is also spelt in a way to reference Walt Whitman’s famous poem,
“Pioneers! O Pioneers!”. This was confirmed by Ruby in an interview with Genius.

“O Pana!” was released in 2016 in their album Eternal Grey and instantly became one of the more notable songs from the album, amassing over ten-million views combined from the two most popular videos uploaded to YouTube.

            <p style="color: white;">
